  - [ ] calculator
  - [X] openconnect-sso
** TODO Setup [11/16]
  - [X] openconnect-sso
    + [X] add new ssh key to [[https://pwtools.embl.de/sshkey][EMBL pwtools]]
  - [X] micromamba \w vscode

  - [X] firmware updates
  - [X] sops-nix handling of user secrets
  - [X] plasma-nm plugin
    + plasma-nm loads the QT5 version
    + kdePackages.plasma-nm loads the *correct* Qt6 version
    + ~kdePackages.plasma-nm~ also provides the correct widget
  - [X] ssh-config
    + probably nicer with sops-nix
    + how can home-manager have access to sops secrets without running a user-level sops module?
    + https://foo-dogsquared.github.io/nixos-config/03-project-specific-setup/03-secrets-management/
    + nix-sops only puts secrets into files
    + how can the nix config get that secret out of the file? The aim is to not store the secret in the nix store and having to refer to the secret-file's location there
  - [X] fingerprint scanning
  - [ ] sync calendars
  - [ ] light/dark switches of tool bars are inverted
  - [ ] write style config package
  - [ ] nixfmt
  - [X] dev shell \w vscode
  - [ ] impermanence \luks crypt
* Overlays and Overrides
  - Use case: openconnect-sso package is broken, but there is a fork fixing this
  - Solution: point flake input to fork repo; add overlay and build the config
  - How does adding the overlay really work?
  - How do I 'build' my config
